# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Movie List React App

This is a React app that displays a list of movies retrieved from hardcoded values in a JavaScript file. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface for viewing and interacting with the movie list.

## Installation

To run the Movie List React App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-list-react-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd movie-list-react-app
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can perform the following actions:

- Scroll through the list of movies to view their titles and details.
- Click on a movie to view additional information or perform delete actions.

The movie list is retrieved from a hardcoded JavaScript file located at src/data/movies.js. If you want to modify the movie list, follow these steps:

1.  Open the movies.js file located in the src/data directory.
2.  Update the array of movies with your desired movie objects. Each movie object should have properties such as title, genre, releaseYear, and description.
3.  Save the file.

The app will automatically update and display the modified movie list.

## Folder Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```bash
