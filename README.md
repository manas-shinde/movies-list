# Movie List React App

This is a React app that displays a list of movies retrieved from hardcoded values in a JavaScript file. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface for viewing and interacting with the movie list.

## Installation

To run the Movie List React App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-list-react-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd movie-list-react-app
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can perform the following actions:

- Scroll through the list of movies to view their titles and details.
- Click on a movie to view additional information or perform delete actions.

The movie list is retrieved from a hardcoded JavaScript file located at src/data/movies.js. If you want to modify the movie list, follow these steps:

1.  Open the movies.js file located in the src/data directory.
2.  Update the array of movies with your desired movie objects. Each movie object should have properties such as title, genre, releaseYear, and description.
3.  Save the file.

The app will automatically update and display the modified movie list.
